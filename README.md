# ecstuning_giveaway
 toying around with giveaway automated entry

## Purpose
Go to a specified url, fill out the form, click submit. Do so with the right tail of a random distribution (random, but with a floor value because data entry speed in real life would reach a lower limit.) in wait times before submitting.

## Requirements
- Python 3
    - selenium
    - numpy
    - time
- Chromedriver

### But why, stuart?
I built this to practice object oriented programming and create a class for this task as a quick proof of concept. This is really not intended to be anything immediately useful for others.

### Should I use it?
Probably not, as the entry rules have some vague language and I'm sure it would disqualify you from winning. Also, it uses Capchas which I didn't feel like fighting.
